        <h3>Pure Builds</h3>
        <p>We've been maintaining and refining <a href="https://github.com/cargo2nix/cargo2nix">cargo2nix</a> in order to tackle native dependencies on both Linux and Mac, bringing an end to "works for me." Our dev bootstrapping works every time. No more divergence over time and head-scratching surprises on the first day. Getting new engineers ramped quickly has never been so reliable</p>

        <h3>Integrate Fast</h3>
        <p>With tools like <a href="https://skaffold.dev/">Skaffold</a>, gain a development workflow very similar to your production environment, eliminating variables and unifying your team's expertise around a smaller set of more common themes.  Why rack up legacy debt because of creep when you can get dividends from commonality?</p>

        <h3>In Production</h3>

## Ship Rust This Week

[Contact us](mailto:contact@positron.solutions) with a short description of the
Rust software you anticipate building and we'll get back to you with either one
of our already open-sourced solutions or quote you for the parts we don't
already have on the shelf. Many problems are quite common, and if we know your
problem, we can split cost across clients and bundle several results for more
value-add

## [More From the Future](/careers)

We want to move the ecosystem in addition to packaging its best
solutions. While the founding mission was to get our stack out there, there's a
lot more on the horizon. Check our [careers](/careers) page for more
information!
